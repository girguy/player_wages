The goal of this project was to answer a simple question : Is it possible to predict the salary of a soccer player based on its performances and some of its
caracteristics on the pitch ?
To who and when the answer of this question is important ? Players, Players agent, clubs financial director, recruiters, etc. 
When is it important to answer this question ? For contract negotiation, a coming transfer or when a choice has to be made between
two or more players to recruit or to sell.. Plenty of situations exists.

This dashboard gives to these actors an idea of how much a player should earn, the caracteristics that
affects the most such a salary (Reactions, Team, ball control, etc). It gives you an idea of if a player is underpaid or overpaid.

But attention, data do not tell the whole story. In this case this model do not take into account, the star power of player.
Kylian Mbappe is the highest-paid player in Europe's top five league.
He earns 3.68 more money than Kevin Debruyn, one of the best player in the world. Does it mean that Mbappe his 3.68 time better
then Kevin Debruyn ? No. 

This work is not finshed yet as I would like to add a page with Players similarities.
A medium article will be written to explain some concepts such as Feature importance, 
So more to come!

The data were found on SoFoot.com, processed with Polars and Pandas (for the training).
I used LightGBM to train my regressor, a K-Means cluster was used to find the class of incomes.
This dashboard was made using PowerBI and was displayed in a Streamlit app via the iframe of the
powerbi dashboard (free solution).
